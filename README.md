# Project chatbot
We developed a music bot which asks your mode and offers a song depending on its own mode ☺ 
This project was done in pairs. And we experienced pair programming for the first time. 
The main target was to practicing DOM, conditionals, functions and variables. 

## The problem

We proceeded according to the given iterations. The first step was adding a start button to activate the greeting. After the users first input, we proceeded to the next question in turn.
It changes the background color depending on the users input and offers alternative music styles. At the end of the conversation, it plays a song. When we finished the structure then we styled it.
We wanted to keep it simple so we wouldn’t get confused at the beginning of our js learning.  
If we had more time, the bot could have a better logical conversation with more functions.
